# Question 1: What is the remainder when you divide 2510876961 by 7?
# Don't forget to print your result to the screen!
num_1 = 2510876961
num_2 = 7
## Fill in your code below, 1 line ##


## End question 1
print(num_1%num_2)
# Question 2: Python will place a higher order of importance to
# operations specified within parenthesis. If you are given the 3
# numbers below and asked to add the first two numbers first, then
# divide by the third one, uncomment the line below that provides
# the right result
num_1 = 15
num_2 = 25
num_3 = 100
## Uncomment the correct line below based on the question above
# print(num_1 + num_2 / num_3)
# print(num_1 / num_2 + num_3)
# print(num_1 + (num_2 / num_3))

print((num_1 + num_2) / num_3)
## End question 2

# Question 3: Import the randint function from the random module
# so it can be used by it's name, randint, instead of referring
# to the random module first
## Write your code below, 1 line ##
from random import     randint

my_num = randint(5,100) 
## End question 3
